- **React.js**: For developing the frontend interface.
- **Apache Kafka**: For asynchronous messaging between services.
- **MySQL**: For database management (or specify your database of choice).
- **Docker**: For containerization and easy deployment.
- **Maven**: For project management and build automation.
- **Postman**: For testing API endpoints.
- **Configuration Servers**: For centralized configuration management.
- **Discovery Server (Eureka)**: To facilitate service discovery in microservices.
- **API Gateway**: To route requests to appropriate microservices.
- **Synchronous Communication**: Using OpenFeign and Rest Templates for service interactions.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implemented with Zipkin and Spring Actuator for monitoring requests.
- **Security**: Using Keycloak for identity and access management.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For setting up infrastructure and required tools.

### Normal User

- **Meal Ordering**: Normal users can easily browse the restaurant's menu, place orders, and customize their preferences. The intuitive interface ensures a user-friendly experience.
